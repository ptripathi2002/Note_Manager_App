# Note-Manager-App:-

It is basically a MERN stack note-manager which is having CRUD functionalities using which we can add a new note, read that note, updated that note as well as delete that note.

For all this I have used React.js,HTML,CSS, for the frontend part implementation and,
Node.js, Express.Js, mongoose and MongoDB for the backend part.

As mentioned in the assignment which was assigned to me, we needed to use a WYWSGI editor so for that I have used react-quill.


In this Note-Manager, I have also added the functionality that on adding the note and clicking on add button the note will get downloaded in HTML form in that particular format only in which the user has written the note in the quill textbox.




## How you can run it in your system:-

Clone the project from my github repository.

Use a editor of your choice(preferrrable:- VSCode)
Then, enter into the backend folder, and install all the packages using the command "npm i" (make sure that you are inside the correct directory that is the backend folder).

After this thing, come inside the frontend folder and, install the required packages using the command "npm i".

After all this move to the backend folder and run the command in the terminal :- "nodemon server"
This will let your backend part started.

Then, move to the frontend folder and run the command in the terminal:- "npm start" 
This will ley your frontend part started.
